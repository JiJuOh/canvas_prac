# canvas_prac
It is a painting practice using canvas tag. <br>
In the canvas, There are two bears and their house on a grass field.

Later, 
I will add a function that 
- user can draw light rays, snow, and rain drops by mouse clip
- light lighting through the ray
- snows and rain drops that user drew keep falling down and appear again 

### You can check the result here
