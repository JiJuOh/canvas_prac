# canvas_prac
It is a painting practice using canvas tag. <br>
In the canvas, There are two bears and their house on a grass field.

I will add some functions that 
- user can draw light rays in day mode or stars in night mode
- the size are set by the point where the user clicked
- after 5 seconds of last click, light rays and stars are twinkling.
